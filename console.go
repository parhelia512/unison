// AttachConsole attempts to fix Windows console output, which is generally broken thanks to their oddball and
// unnecessary split between graphical and command-line applications. This attempts to fix that by attaching the console
// so that a graphical application can also be used as a command-line application without having to build two variants.
// May be called more than once. Subsequent calls do nothing. Does nothing on non-Windows platforms.
